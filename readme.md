## Buildpacks tutorial

### About this project

This project is cloned from [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) and it's purpose is to showcase how [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) works.

### Requirements

* [`pack` CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack/)
* Docker daemon

### Getting started

First, choose one of the suggested builder from the output of this command:

```
pack suggest-builders
```

As this is a Java application, choose one with a buildpack for Java, for example `cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic`. You could choose a builder from another source or even build your own ([Create a buildpack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/) and [Create a builder](https://buildpacks.io/docs/operator-guide/create-a-builder/)).

Once you've chosen a builder, you can build it as follows:

```
pack build <image-name> --builder <builder-name>
```

For example:

```
pack build petclinic:buildpack --builder cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic
```

From the command output you can determine which buildpacks where involved and which layers where rebuilt. Once your image is built, use `docker images` to see it and `docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm <image-name>:<tag>` to run it.

### Inspecting an image

Once you have built your image, you can inspect it to see some metadata:

 ```
 pack inspect-image <image-name>
 ```

 For example, building this petclinic application with `cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic` and then inspecting it returns the following output:

 ```
 REMOTE:

LOCAL:

Stack: io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic

Buildpacks:
  ID                                                VERSION
  org.cloudfoundry.openjdk                          v1.2.14
  org.cloudfoundry.buildsystem                      v1.2.15

Processes:
  TYPE                  SHELL        COMMAND                                                                                          ARGS
  web (default)         bash         java -cp $CLASSPATH $JAVA_OPTS org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication
  executable-jar        bash         java -cp $CLASSPATH $JAVA_OPTS org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
  spring-boot           bash         java -cp $CLASSPATH $JAVA_OPTS org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication
  task                  bash         java -cp $CLASSPATH $JAVA_OPTS org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication
 ```

We can see the buildpacks that this image has used for its building process, the name of the stack used (useful for rebasing our image to another stack) and the reference for the top layer of the stack. You can also use the flag `--bom`, which returns a *bill of materials* as a JSON object, with more information about each layer.

Inspecting an image can be done in images generated by Buildpacks, as well as in any other image. Keep in mind other images may not contain this kind of metadata in them.
